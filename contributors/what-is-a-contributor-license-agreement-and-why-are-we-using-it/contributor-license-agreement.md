You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction \(including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks\) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

You agree that Your Contributions are given to Us without coercion or duress of any form or manner. You agree that You are of sane mind while Submitting Your Contributions to Us. The act of You Submitting Your Contributions to Us does NOT constitute any formal relationship of any form or manner.
