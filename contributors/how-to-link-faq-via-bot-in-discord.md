# How to link FAQ via bot in Discord

## Intro 🍁

As a community of investors, we get queries from time to time, that are frequently asked. Often repeatedly.

We have FAQs on our wiki, for queries such as these, that addresses such queries. But having it in an archive is of no value, if it cannot be searched and linked, as and when needed.

We've a setup that solves this problem - any active member can invoke the bot with a specific tag, and the bot would take care of presenting right information to the user.

We'll explore next how to invoke this bot

## List of tags 📚

We use Carl-bot's tag feature at present to achieve this.

Every time a new FAQ entry is created, it gets a corresponding `tag` entry for Carl bot.

List of all available tag-based triggers can be found by typing `.taglist` in `#test` channel in our Discord.

Once this message is typed, Carl-bot would DM you the list of available tags.

Above image\(s\) are illustrative. Actual list can be different, and change from time to time. For latest updated list, you can use `.taglist` in `#test` channel.

Bot would delete your message, and add its own message, tagging `@beginnerinvestor`
