  Smallcase has tools which can aid in managing a stock portfolio better than
  most brokerage options. But do your own due diligence before you invest in a
  smallcase because the CAGR looks great.

# Is smallcase a good investment? Returns look good.

There are two parts to investing via smallcase:

* The tooling, around managing a watchlist of stocks, executing transactions at portfolio level rather than at scrip level
* The selection process, which constructs a stock portfolio, based on some parameters or subjective quality-based factors

No doubt, the usability of smallcase as a tool to manage a stock portfolio is quite good.

If you already have a plan to invest in a stock portfolio, you can create that watchlist and place orders using smallcase.

The second aspect, requires smallcase having a proven track record, and people responsible for maintaining that particular portfolio have pedigree when it comes stock selection / rejection.

These are few things to note:

* Depending on the churn there can be significant tax drag for you since you will be buying and selling units regularly. Smallcase is known to rebalance most of their portfolios every 90 days.
* Lack of proven track record that can be independently verified.

  AMCs are legally required to publish their daily NAVs, and their portfolios every month. Which means an AMC can't give you random numbers, they are forced to keep everything in the public's eyes. This is not true for smallcases.

  1Y return of Axis Bluechip fund \(not a recommendation, using as an illustration\) would be same on every platform - Morningstar, Moneycontrol, Valuereasearch, Kuvera, Groww, PayTM Money, Piggy, INDMoney etc. Because these platforms know the NAV of this fund from both a year ago, and today; and 1 year return can be computed from that. You can compute it too, to verify independently, from historic NAV on AMC's website or AMFI.

  It isn't feasible for anyone who's not working at Smallcase to extract portfolio of a particular smallcase from 2 years ago, as on that date. There's no public record.

* Smallcase loves selling "Backtested Models".

  Backtesting needs to be free from various biases, such as, _look-ahead bias_. Strategy derived from a backtest, would always show great results when simulated over the same time period.

  It's possible for anyone who's basic interest in markets, to say what stocks would have done great for a decade, if purchased in 2010. A poorly executed "backtest" is a fancy version of looking back and picking winners.

* There are also some concerns around smallcase not being upfront with their numbers

  They include backtested portfolio in computing returns of the smallcase, which is not at all how any asset management services report their returns. Start dates of the same portfolio also fluctuate, when checked at different dates.

Finally, keep in mind that past returns are not indicative of future returns; and asset returns can be very different from portfolio returns. Just because a smallcase has CAGR of 40%, does NOT mean \(and almost certainly the case\), that investors in same smallcase, over same time period, has 40% p.a. return on their portfolio.

**TL;DR: use the product if you like it; but not because you think their advice alone would make you great returns.**
