# I cannot send messages to stocks-fundamentals channel on Discord. Why?

This channel is meant for sharing fundamental analysis on a business that you're tracking. It has a higher bar for participation, as compared to other channels here.

We want to weed out low effort queries on specific stock - _should I buy IRFC_, _should I sell Y now that it has given me 30% return_ etc.

We expect that not everyone would be able to participate there. If you're not sure about how to go about that, read the pinned messages in that channel, to skill up. We are also working on our wiki that should give you right exposure to areas you need.

If you've a thesis for investing in a company, or not investing, for that matter - please share those in \#general-talk or \#ask-us-any-question first.

We evaluate these from time to time, and if your comments here on the server meet the bar, you'd be granted that role.

This is a privilege, and you've to earn it.
