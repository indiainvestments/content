# Up to what age should I take term cover?

Insurance companies these days, commonly offer term cover up to age 70, or even age of 80. This is even highlighted in their sales brochures or marketing materials.

That doesn't necessarily mean you'd need to actually buy a policy, that covers you till age of 80.

A term cover is an _income replacement_ plan. That is, there are family members, who are financially dependent upon your income. In the event of your demise, the term cover payout is supposed to cover for that.

By the time you're of retirement age say 60-65 year old, no one in your family should be dependent on your income. You should have amassed enough wealth through decades of investing & savings, that in the event of your demise, your nominess can just inherit those.

Simpler analogy would be how you don't need an umbrella once you're under a roof, even if it's raining outside.

Take term cover up to an age that you think your financial dependents would be dependent on your income. Going beyond that, only increases the premium, without any benefit to you or your family.
