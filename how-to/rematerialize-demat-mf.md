# How to rematerialize mutual fund from demat form

### Intro 💫 <a id="Intro"></a>

There can be some disadvantages and inconveniences for having the mutual funds in _dematerialized_ \(aka demat\) form. 

Some of these are

1. Difficult to change the investment platform or DP \(**D**epository **P**articipant\) 
2. Vendor lock-in, where you are locked to the brokerage platform and its subset of functionalities. 
3. You will have to pay various charges like annual charges, depository charges etc.

Often, you might find it more cost effective to sell your demat holdings through your broker, and re-buy units in non-demat mode in same fund's direct plan; than going through this process.  
  
You should consider the alternative course of action and estimate your costs for both these processes.

Below steps will help you to understand how to convert your mutual funds in demat form.

### Steps to re-materialize 👩🏽‍🏫 <a id="Steps-to-rematerialise"></a>

1. Get 2 copies of Re-materialization Request Form for re-materialization from DP for each ISIN \(**I**nternational **S**ecurities **I**dentification **N**umber\) / scrip / mutual fund. 
2. Submit the form signed by all the holders along with SOA \(**S**tatement **o**f **A**ccount\), Self attested address proof and PAN to the DP. 
3. DP does the verification and process the request. 
4. RRN \(**R**e-materialization **R**equest **N**umber\) is generated for tracking. 
5. On confirmation of details provided, the corresponding accepted balance in the BO’s \(**B**eneficiary **O**wner\) account is reduced from that ISIN balance in the BO’s Account. 
6. The AMC / RTA sends the SoA/certificate in physical or electronic form directly to the _Registered Owner_.

1. Charges for re-materialization may apply \(as decided by the DP\).
2. Partial conversion may not be possible.
3. Re-materialization of lien-marked units cannot be done.
