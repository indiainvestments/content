#### How to Evaluate Life Insurance Needs

**Things to ponder over**

Apparently, most people tend to be under-insured. That's because what generally happens is that they get approached by some Life Insurance agent who works on a commission basis that throws around some jargon\(despite what the advertisements say, this still happens\), shows you an amount that looks 'big enough' on maturity or death. You ask how much premium is required, you take a cursory look at your monthly savings and wonder if you can go for it, you arrive at a plan that you think is affordable and boom, you pat yourself for being a responsible adult. More often than not, it is NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

There are other things that happen too. Let's look at what happened with the Mumbai Terror attacks of 2008.

1. The Government announced a 2 lakhs compensation for the victims who were killed. 1 lakh for the ones who were seriously injured. _Ask yourself this, how long will your family last on 2 lakhs?_
2. A family member of a victim said in an interview "My brother had a policy but I do not know the details of the same or where he has kept it." This is a more common occurrence that you would think. People tend to take life insurance but keep the details of these to themselves. May be it's because of cultural reasons. \(For example: I don't have a spouse, so when I announced to my parents that I had taken a life insurance and enlisted them as beneficiaries, my mother went 'Tu chup kar, aisi baathein nahi karte!' \(_Don't talk about such things_\). I just told my father about which company that I was insured with. They have no idea about the amount of benefit they are entitled to in the event of my death. For those of you who are insured, ask yourself this : _Do you know exactly what amount of money your family will receive in the event of your death? and then Does your family know how much benefit they are entitled to and how to go about it?_
3. "Is terrorism covered?" On the life insurance platform, insurers pay the sum assured for basic life insurance in case of death due to reasons other than suicide. This means that a life insurance policy will pay in case of death due to terrorism. _However_ Additional riders\(for which you pay a little bit extra premium for\), like personal accident \(PA\) rider, which usually pay double the sum assured, will not cover acts of terrorism in most cases. Major surgical benefit, too, may not be paid if a policyholder undergoes surgeries arising out of a terror attack. _Ask yourself this, what are the different ways in which you could possibly die/get disabled, does your policy and additional riders cover all these scenarios?_

_**Here's hoping that I now have your attention, we will now move towards the fundamental question, how much insurance do YOU need?**_

In my opinion\(humble ofcourse\), Life Insurance should not be about saving tax nor should it be about making an investment or maturity amount. It should quite simply be, a means providing for your family, protecting their lifestyle if you are not around and ensuring that the goals for which you have worked so hard are achievable if you drop dead. Which ofcourse implies that everyone's needs are going to be different.

Now there's multiple ways of doing this which have been broadly labelled as _'Income method'_, _Human Life Value Method_ and _'Needs Analysis Method'_ . Let's start with my favorite:

**Needs Analysis Method**

_Step 1:_ Determine the one-time expenses of your dependants \(like clearing off your loans, siblings/children's education and/or marriage, etc.\). Let's call this amount 'A'

_Step 2:_ Estimate your dependant's annual recurring expenses. This is 'B'.

_Step 3:_ Estimate survivor's annual income. Do your parents/spouse/siblings also work? Cool. 'C'

_Step 4:_ 'B' - 'C' = 'D' \(Annual shortfall\)

_Step 5:_ Multiply 'D' by the number of years you expect the youngest dependant or child to become independent and after that until your spouse is 80 or 90 years old. 'E'

_Step 6:_ 'A' + 'E' = 'F'inancial Risk that you NEED to cover.

_Step 7:_ Calculate the total investments and assets that you own. 'G'.

_Step 8:_ Amount of current life insurance. 'H'

_Step 9:_ 'F' - 'G' - 'H' = 'I'nsurance cover that you'll need to buy. If 'I' is negative, you don't have to do anything.

Now, the challenge with the above method is guesstimating exactly how much money you're dependants are going to need on a yearly basis. You will have to factor in inflation and the averate rate of return on your investments. It's a huge exercise but if you truly louve and care for your dependants and all that, it is worth the effort.

**Income Method**

The Income method is more like a rule of thumb method and it goes like this.

Take your NET Annual Income and then:

If you are below 35 years, multiply it with 15.

If you are between 35 and 50, multiply it with 12.

If you are over 50, multiply it with 10.

That's it. The resultant amount should be the amount of cover you ought to have.

**Human Life Value Method**

This one's a little technical but shouldn't be a problem if you understand the concepts of Time Value of Money,

_Life ProTip: Learn the concepts of Time Value of Money. If you have an average IQ, it won't take more than a day_

The most common definition of HLV is the expected life time earnings of an individual, i.e. what is the total income that the individual is expected to earn over the remainder of his working life, expressed in present Rupee terms.

_Step 1:_ Find your current income. Deduct all expenses. 'A'

_Step 2:_ Find your remaining working life or Years left to retirement. 'B'

_Step 3:_ Find the discounting factor rate. \(For example, the rate of interest assumed for capitalisation of future income/salary growth rate\). 'C%'

_Step 4:_ Find out the present value of required income stream by using inflation adjusted return.

In Excel, this would be =PV\(C%,B,A,0,1\)

Once you've ascertained the amount of insurance you'll be needing, the next step is to evaluate the different types of insurance products that are out there.

[Here's a useful link that breaks stuff down for the common man](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1r01zr/quick_reference_hand_books_with_faqs_life/)

Remember, Insurance planning is an integral part of your overall retirement planning which in turn is a part of your overall Financial Planning. You do not necessarily need a personal Financial Planner to get this right. One of the objectives of this subreddit is to ensure that you make all your financial decisions independently.

Here's hoping this post moves you into action. If it doesn't, just try not to die.

#### Different Types of Insurance

1. Life Insurance
2. Medical Insurance
3. Others: Disability / Home

**Life Insurance: What it is exactly?**

Life Insurance is basically a Death Insurance and better term is **Income Replacement Insurance**. It is a transfer of risk of your death, in terms of financial liability, from you to the insurance company. Like a car insurance, if something happens to the car, the insurance company will pay for the repairing work / or pay an amount according to the value assigned in case it gets stolen. Similarly, a life insurance is a contract between you and the insurance company, in which the company takes money \(_=premium_\) to ensure that it will provide money \(_=life cover value_\) in case of death of the insured person \(like Stolen car analogy\).

To re-emphasize, by buying a life insurance policy, you have transferred the risk of your death \(by disease, accident, etc\) to the company.

**Principles:**

The Life insurance Cover should be the **sum of**

* All liabilities \(loans – personal, home loan, relatives, etc\)
* The amount which provides income required to maintain the current lifestyle.
* Should be able to provide for future liabilities like child education, home, marriage.
* It is better to be over-insured rather than under-insured. A reasonable amount is 10-15 times the annual income. This rule translates into a corpus amount, which invested properly will provide \(1/15 to 1/10=\) **6.7% to 10%** of return and that amount is sufficient to provide the family a decent amount of income, which can then be used for daily expenses and rest for investing, etc.
* Only term insurance will be able to give you the above cover at a reasonable valuation. And like when we go with car insurance, we try to find a good deal, similarly presently, the online term insurance policies provide the maximum bang for buck.
* One or Two term policies. You need to remember that the insurance will be required to be encashed by your family after your death, so someone from the immediate family or close relative / friend should know the procedure of getting it. Online plans are available in most large cities and provided by most ~~non-LIC~~ insurance companies \(LIC and most Private now\).
* Non-term insurance plans. These are basically insurance plans in which besides the premium amount for life insurance \(so this expense is there in these too and does not get removed at all\), the extra money is put into various investment options.
* In endowment policies \(most LIC policies are these\), the extra amount is kept by LIC/non-LIC company in a non-transparent manner and “invested” by them and later after very many years, they provide the cover value + bonuses \(which are not guaranteed in amount\).
* In ULIPs \(unit linked insurance policies\), there is a reasonable amount of transparency in terms of what are the various expenses and how they are distributed in various heads Plus in most of the policies, you can even decide the type of investment options. In general, these are much better than the opaque policies.
* Return of Premium Term Insurance- This is cheaper type of moneyback policy, in which beyond the basic life insurance cover, an extra amount is taken by the company to generate a corpus which will equal the total mortality charge over the time period of the insurance policy. These are invariably costlier than basic vanilla term insurance.
* Accident / Disability riders. With the detailed analysis of various riders, if you read the terms and conditions, then these riders are not really worth the amount of money spent on them. I will not recommend them in the way they are presently available.

**More Consideration about Options**

There are 2 major categories now available:

1. Offline 
2. Online.

The only major difference between the two is that the offline plans include the **agent commission**, while the online plan is devoid of that and indirectly you become your agent. Apart from that, the processing of papers initially, the medical tests, the claim process \(in case it is needed\) are the same for both the offline and online plans. And of course, since you are the self-agent, you have to fill the forms, attach the appropriate documents and send them to the company \(basic rule is if you can reddit, you can do that too\).

Points related to LIC:

LIC is the biggest company in every which way you see, in terms of number of policies, the total amount of insurance coverage, etc. However, there are 2 major points against it:

1. Even though it was established in 1956, it did not start Plan vanilla term insurance till early 2000s, and only after HDFC Standard introduced it \(I do not have the reference for that right now\). 
2. ~~Although, there were rumors about it getting an online variety, but few reports show that LIC has completely dropped the idea and Offline term plans \(Anmol Jeevan for 25L\) are available only.~~ EDIT: They have an online term policy now \(although, the premium is on a higher side as compared to other online policies\).

Important points for filling of any insurance policy-

1. **Give accurate information about whatever is being asked**. This is the single most important thing to follow. The emphasis is on 'BEING ASKED', and that also means you do not need to go out of your way to provide information which has not been asked. If you have any doubt, call the customer care and get more information. You have so many options, that even if you reject 1 or 2 based on bad or confusing customer care, you still will be able to get another one with decent service. If the website is bad, customer care is bad, you need not proceed with the company at all. After all, if it is bad now, it cannot be good later on, if your family really need to file a claim process.
2. **Ask how the claim process is done.** Most companies will show the claim process in some way on their website. Check it out. Usually, it is by providing death certificate and filling up of the claim form, which then has to be submitted to the insurance company's branch office \(the agent may or may not help in this, so do not count solely on this. Who knows where will be the agent after 15 years.\)
3. **Medical Test.** This is done to refine the analysis of the risk taken by the company. If you adopt a cynical attitude, you will think that the medical test is unnecessary and just a way for the company to increase the premium \(yes, there have been instances in which companies have done that in the name of increased nicotine levels or borderline hypertension or borderline high blood sugar or similar, but in most cases they will just ask for an increased premium and not rejecting it\). If the company has increased the premium, then it is all the more good because if a claim is filed, then the company cannot say that this was not disclosed or that was not disclosed, etc. _In short, if the company does not ask for a medical test, no problem. If it ask for a medical test, and does not increase the premium – good again. And if it increases the premium- still good. If it rejects because of the medical test, then its a problem and you will need to find out why that is so \(also, this may be asked in later policies\)._
4. **The 15-day return option.** One can return any policy \(any means any policy approved by IRDA\) within 15 days of RECEIVING it \(not STARTING it\). The day you receive it is zero day for returning, while the insurance cover starts a little earlier \(when the company has generated the policy after medical tests, etc\). If you are not happy with the way the company has handled the policy or their customer care or any thing, which you think can be an issue later on, you can return the policy and get back your money. The amount spent on medical tests is deducted with some nominal amount on paper work, while rest is given back. A small negative will be if you ask for another insurance policy to this or another company and they ask you about any previous policy, then you will be better off telling them about this episode \(but only if they explicitly ask for it\).
5. The Company has after assessing the Risk and Medical checkup asked for **Loading**. _Should I take it now or leave it?_ Of course, you should **TAKE** it. This means they have assessed you properly and with the proper re-assessment want to take that chance with your life. That only makes it a better policy for your family, since it is more likely that they do not consider that you are a horrible risk to them. In reality, you also want that assurance, indirectly. Secondly, if you will not go ahead with the Loaded amount, the company will reject it. And any such rejection will work against you when you will want to have another life insurance policy.
6. **Claim Settlement Ratio.** This is much shown ratio comparing different companies, their settlement and payment ratios. It is a complex ratio which does not differentiate between pure term insurance \(offline or online\) or endowment and ulips and just clumps all of them into a single ratio. If you will see the number of policies and the total amount of settlement done, you can arrive at an average amount of cover per policy. The lower this amount, the higher will be the percentage of non-term insurance policies.

The reasons for claim rejection are:

1. Wrong medical or any other relevant \(or non-relevant\) data provided by the policy holder, whether online \(on his own\) or offline \(either self or agent filled in wrong information\).
2. Wrong doing by the company. In this case, the insurance ombudsman is the way. However, the policy claim process is stuck. This also includes ways by which the process can be stalled or is deemed complicated because of logistical reasons. Eg, the recent floods in uttarakhan causing large number of deaths. It is difficult for the company to verify if the person is dead, or missing or some kind of fraudulent behavior on the part of the policyholder.

Just remember, no company has a 100% claim settlement ratio. Ask the customer care or the agent about it and think about their answer.

**Companies and Options:**

1. ~~If you want to have LIC and LIC only \(because it is govt-backed, or its claim settlement ratio is highest, or xyz, then the offline plan is the only option.~~ For private companies, ICICI, Kotak, HDFC, SBI Life are decent. There is an approximate halving of the premium between comparable offline policies between LIC and others. So, decide upon it.
2. For Online options, Religare, Aviva, ICICI, HDFC, Kotak – all are game. Short informaiton about Aegon Religare- it was the first company to introduce online term insurance facility. With time, they put in some more refinements \(and also because of competition\), they decreased the premium. And added additional coverage to already existing customers \(I have never come across any such thing from any other company\) when they decreased the premium. LIC online is also available now. 

Do check the website of the individual companies, check the premium \(recheck whether the premium shown is with or without the service tax\) and then go ahead.

TL;DR- go ahead with the easiest company which you find, with a decent amount of cover, and which does not give you \(or your family\) heartburn regarding settlement of a claim, if it arises.

**A Short Note about Financial Structure:**

Why does a term insurance levies same amount of premium for the entire term, when it should be lesser in earlier years and more in the later years? I will try to explain in an example.

Eg, for a 5 year term for a 30 year person will charge, say 10000 per year. For the first year, the applicable mortality charge will be 6000, while the rest of the 4000 will be invested by the company into a debt type of instrument. Similarly for the next year, because of increased age, the mortality charge will be 7000, the rest 300 being invested. At year 4, the mortality charge would be 14000, which will be paid partly by the 10000 of the premium, and rest 4000 from the initally invested part-premium monies. This is just an approximation to give you an idea how the insurance company takes into account a same premium for a term insurance.

Some more detail about [financial structure](http://www.navhindtimes.in/business/financial-structure-term-insurance-plan).

**OTHER TYPES of TERM PLANs:**

_**Return of Premium \(ROP\) Plans:**_

These type of plans are sold in a way to show that you get your premiums back. However, these do not come in online options \(so much more premium\). And, because of the ROP factor, the insurance premium is more than a normal offline plan so as to invest the surplus in a debt instrument and that is given back at the end of the plan.

Additional Disadvantage: If one wants to leave the plan in between, the extra premium amount paid to the company is not given back. The plan makes you stick to it for the complete duration.

Corollary Advantage: For people, who know that without such a loss-potential they will not sustain an insurance plan, can opt for this plan, as this is the least costly endowment plan. And, 'At least, some thing is coming back' mentality is taken care of.

_**Increasing / Decreasing Term Cover plan:**_

The main idea in these is that the Sum assured value should be dynamic and related to inflation or amount of responsibilities, etc.

In my opinion, these just create additional complications.

A good way to analyse things is in terms of **Total Dependency cover** which equals **Life Insurance Cover + \(Financial Assets – Liabilities\)**.

With age, the \(Assets – Liabilities\) should increase in a good way, so the Dependency cover automatically increases with time. If the Assets are not increasing, then it is a bigger problem in any case. So, keeping the Insurance Cover constant is not a bad option.

#### Short Primer on Life Insurance as a comment

#### Some FAQs on Life Insurance

**Q1. What happens if the company I have bought insurance from goes bust?** Is there any mechanism to protect customers like Deposit insurance corporation?

**A1.** The IRDA regulations mandate that the solvency ratio \(mainly indicates the assets versus liability adequacy\) of the insurance company should have a decent margin of safety. Check this [Link](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/insurance-the-risk-factor/1071108/0) for more details. Currently, all the companies have decent solvency ratios. Hence, we do not need Deposit Insurance corp or any other such fallback for that.

**Q2. How do insurance companies use funds to pay?** Is it 'pay as you go' OR 'is it that they invest the money and pay accordingly when the claim arises'?

**A2.** In short, the latter. In the longer form the basic idea is that the mortality actuarial rates of the life insurance premium is calculated in such a way that probability wise, insurers make money on those. Eg, for a person of age of 30, the old mortality rate \(used by LIC\) was 1% \(example\) then they would price it as 2%. On a probability play, they are betting that if 100 persons aged 30 take Re 1 insurance per person, then only 1 of them dies \(on an average because the mortality rate is 1%\). They would then have to pay Re 1 to the dead person's family and keep the rest \(Re 1\) as profit. for regular term insurance, the company sets up a way to invest partially the extra premium \(1% from the total 2% of the above example\) and uses it to compensate in the later years. for single payment term insurance, the above is done in a much bigger way. for ulips / endowment policies, whether they are transparent or opaque, the mortality premia are deducted from the total amount regularly and work in a similar way as the first example.

**Q3. Can I have 2 insurance plans at the same time?**

**A3.** Yes. But you will have to declare that in any subsequent plan, if you already have any. The company considers if the total cover is within its risk profile or not. Eg, you can have 1 crore cover. You can take 1 policy. But if you already have a 50L policy, company will say, sorry boss, we don't feel comfortable providing you an additional 1 crore plan. If you are ok with 50L, we can do so.

**Q4. Should I have 2 insurance plans of half the cover each, instead of 1 single large plan?** This will diversify the risk of claim rejection. This is a little difficult question. It is probably a simpler idea to have only one large term insurance plan because it is much easier for the family to get claim later on. If the company creates any issue, then the insurance ombudsman is the way to go. An alternative is if you already have some other small policy, continue that policy and use that as the diversification tool. The rule is that if one company pays up ANY policy in case of demise of the policy-holder, no other company can reject the claim \(citation needed\).

**Q5. What about the Claim Settlement Ratio?**

**A5.** I will first put up this link = [http://www.subramoney.com/2012/03/insurance-claims-settlement/](http://www.subramoney.com/2012/03/insurance-claims-settlement/)

The basic idea is that the CSR ratios touted on the IRDA sites \(and the individual companies' sites\) are so opaque that you cannot differentiate between data of term insurance versus non-term plans \(way too large in numbers\), actual claims due to death versus maturity of plan, early \(&lt;2 year\) claims versus late claims, etc. Also, consider the fact that how can one apply the CSR data of 2011-12 to a plan which has been introduced subsequently \(most of the online term insurance plans have come later\). In short, it is a completely useless statistic. Just another point to be considered, why is the CSR of LIC not 100% ?

_EDIT:\(2 more\)_

**Q6. Why is there a big difference between Smoker and Non-smoker premium in many Term Plans?**

**A6.** The difference is because some companies have differentiated the mortality rates of smokers and non-smokers and use different rates for them. In general, the chances of dying for someone smoking is more than someone who isn't. So, those companies have different options to pass that benefit to the consumers. Many others have decided not to differentiate between the two categories. If you will look more, you will see that even men and women have different rates.

How to use this? If you are smoker, it would be preferable for you to use a company which does not differentiate between the two, so that there is no issue of this point. While who are complete non-smoker, prefer a company which gives you the benefit of being a non-smoker.

**Q7. Should I go with online or offline plan?**

**A7.** In the offline plan, the agent is in between you and the company and helps you to fill the form \(rightly or in a few cases wrongly\) and he does take a commission out of the total premium. The main point remains in case of claim, to use the services of the agent, \(a\) you would need to stay in the same place, \(b\) the agent has to stay in the same place and \(c\) remain with the same company and \(d\) he needs to really help your family in that case. All 4 conditions have to be met and the chances of that happening decrease with passage of time \(who knows about 10 years down the line\). While the alternate which is always available is to go directly to the insurance company's office, fill the claim form, put the appropriate supporting documents and get the claim. So, understand the two procedures and make the choice.

### Ulip

**BASIC DEFINITION**

This is a single instrument / vehicle which gives Insurance and Investments. It uses the income tax laws to provide tax-free returns\(most of them do, but changing laws sometimes changes the status of such plans – so always do check the actual laws and the relevance of the particular Ulip\).

In other words, Ulip is a _type of mutual fund_ \(in the sense that they get your money, convert them into units and professionally manage the money while charging you a management fee\) which uses the tax laws to make the entire instrument **tax free or as tax-friendly as possible.**

**BASIC TENETS:**

1. **The insurance component:** Usually it is kept to a minimum. Prior to 2-3 years, most of the Ulips had a minimum of 5x premium of insurance cover. Why? Because the tax laws then said that for any insurance plan to get included in 80C section, it had to have a premium of &lt;20% of the insurance cover. eg. If the plan had to have a cover of 1 lakh, then the premium should be less than 20k. Then this limit was changed to 10x \(=max. 10k premium for 1 lakh cover\). However, you need to remember that the insurance cover provided is 10x on the lower side. On the higher side, it can be 20-30x also. There will be proportional increase in the Mortality Charges too. Compare this with the amount of cover which an online policy can give – around 1000x.
2. **The Investment Component**: The money which remains after deduction of the various charges is put into one of the fund\(s\) allowed in the particular fund of that company. Then that money behaves like being in a mutual fund \(gives the name Unit-Linked\).

**VARIOUS CHARGES:**

1. **Mortality Charges-** Since this is an Insurance policy, there are mortality charges which are deducted usually every month \(not quarterly or yearly\). Usually, it is done in terms of Total Cover – Fund Value and the relevant mortality rate is applied. Eg. For a male of 30 years, if the cover is of 10lakhs, while the fund value of the policy is 2 lakh, the rest 8 lakh cover incurs the mortality rate of 1.91 per thousand which means an yearly premium of 1,528 \(or 127 per month\) plus service tax \(12.36%\). If the fund value is 6lakh, the mortality rate will be 764 per annum. Only when the fund value is more than the Cover, the mortality charge becomes Nil. The charge is applied by removing the corresponding amount of Units from your total fund units.
2. **Premium Allocation Charges-** This is a variable rate and is mostly related to the Commission to the Insurance Agent. However, on the lower side, it is @ 2% while some years back it used to be 50-70% in the first year, then 20-30% in second year. Usually it is there in the first 5 years \(basically the absolute or relative lock in periods\). Prior to Sep 1, 2010, the Ulip structures were for 3 year lock in, so the major premium allocation charges were in those 3 years. Later on, the 5 year lock in was put, so the Ulips were redesigned to distribute the charges accordingly. Even the Top Up premiums undergo this charge but usually to a lesser amount. This amount never goes into Insurance or Investment at all.
3. **Policy Administration Charges-** The company charges you this amount to send you monthly statements. It is set to increase yearly and is applied by removing units.
4. **Fund Management Charges-** This is the actual professional management fees of the funds, and they are charged, like any other Mutual Fund, by daily deduction from the NAV of the fund itself. They are usually fixed but canbe increased by the company by intimating it to you.
5. **Surrender charge-** Currently, if you want to surrender your policy in the first 5 years, then it is called Discontinuance and after deduction of charge \(range of 2-6%\), the remaining amount is transferred to a discontinued policy fund \(where it earns 3.5% return, mostly with some kind of fund management charge\) and the final amount is given to you at the end of 5 years. If you surrender the policy after 5 years, then after appropriate surrender charges, the policy is terminated and the fund value is provided to you. For Older Ulip policies, similar terms particular to that policy apply.
6. **Rider Charges-** If the policy has riders like accidental death rider, critical illness rider, etc, then the appropriate amount of those charges are levied by cancellation of units.
7. **Guarantee Option-** Some policies use Guarantee option in providing some sort of guaranteed return. Usually such options are completely debt based options and do incur an additional guarantee charge over and above all the other charges. 

In short, any type of benefit is _charged accordingly_, and nothing is free. The only major difference from the other traditional insurance policies is that everything is clear and written in Ulips while it is not so in those.

**FLEXIBLE OPTIONS:**

1. **Top Up:** Over and above the normal insurance premia, you can put extra amount of money as Top Up Premium. This now requires you to have additional corresponding amount of insurance \(in the older Ulips, the additional insurance cover was not mandatory\). Eg. If by 10k premium you get 1 lakh, an additional 10k top up premium can get you an additional cover which can be variable \(eg from 1.1x to 5x to 10x\). The other difference is that the Premium Allocation Charge is usually lesser than the normal premium. However, in the newer policies, the top up will have a lock-in of 5 years from the date of the top-up.
2. **Switching:** Out of the various fund options available in a policy \(some have 5, some have 7, etc\), you can allocate the entire money in a liquid fund, or a longer term debt fund, a large cap type of fund, mid cap or multi-cap, etc. In general, out of the various options, you can allocate your fund money in parts or in total to 1 or more funds of that policy. Some policies have Automatic Switching options in which according to age, the percentage of equity-debt will change or according to an increase in decrease in the  fund allocations, an appropriate automatic change will occur. Mostly, such additional options do incur charges but this also depends on the policy.
3. **Premium Paying Term \(PPT\):** This is the period for which you will pay regular premiums. Usually the minimum is 5 years \(in older policies, it was 3 years\). However, there are single premium payment policies too. This option appears to be very confusing to many people. If someone opts for a 5 year premium paying term, he/she will be able to regularly pay premium for 5 years, and then depending upon the duration of the policy, after various charges, the net fund value will be given back to the holder at the end of the policy period. Eg, if the premium is 10k yearly for a policy with PPT of 5 years and total policy duration of 10 years, the valuation of those 50k after various charges will be given back at the end of 10 years. It DOES NOT mean that for the empty 5 years from 6-10 years, the company will pay it. Compare this with the same policy with PPT of 10 years and period of 10 years. The fund value will be more than the first example policy. 
4. The PPT, the frequency of paying premium and the Sum Assured are all usually kept flexible and can be **changed**. 
5. After a specific time frame \(mostly 5 years\), there is option for **Partial Withdrawal** of your money from the fund. It behaves like Partial Surrender.

**RISKS:**

The **insurance risk** part is borne by the company and the Mortality Charges are accordingly set. In this way, this part is not different from the plain vanilla term insurance.

The **investment risk** part is completely the responsibility of the policy holder. This is the same as in any Mutual Fund.

**REVIVAL:**

For Ulips, there are usually no Revival options. If the policy is discontinued or foreclosed, then the appropriate option is followed automatically. Compare this with traditional policies, in which a policy can be revived later too.

**What is BAD about Ulips?**

**INSURANCE Part:**

**Firstly**, Insurance is an expense and by combining it with a savings/investment option, the purpose of the entire instrument becomes kind of tug of war between two different aims. The primary way should be to check the eligibility and requirement of the life insurance for the person which includes:

\(I\) Whether life insurance is required or not? If there are no financially dependent persons, life insurance is not required.

\(II\) If it is required, how much is the requirement? For this calculation, check this [post](http://redd.it/16te5b).

The 10-30/40 times premium Sum Assured FOCUSES on the amount of premium which you can pay rather than the primary aim of The Total Sum Assured \(Life cover amount\). Eg. For a 30 year old male, the online plans give a sum assured of approx. 1000 times yearly premium. For offline the corresponding value is anywhere between 500-700. At higher age groups and with large term periods, there is corresponding lowering of the sum assured.

In short, the insurance component of a Ulip is 99% of times inadequate as a sole policy.

**Secondly**, the mortality charge table used in Ulips is higher as compared to mortality charge table for the same company in its own non-ulip term \(offline / online\) policies. In general, the inadequate insurance cover is expensive too.

**INVESTMENT Part:**

**Part 1: CHARGES**

1. The _Premium Allocation Charge_ is a front-loading charge, which means the charge is levied first and then the rest of the money is put for investment. Compare this with ongoing charges like Fund Management Charges or Back-loading \(eg Exit loads in which the charge is levied at the time of withdrawal\). In older times, when there was an Entry Load on the General Mutual Funds, which now is not present. This charge as mentioned is basically a commission charge for the agent and/or company, and does not help the investment in any manner.
2. _Policy Admin Charge_- completely useless charge. Everything can be seen online and this charge is waste of money. Over that, this charge usually increases year on year.
3. _Surrender / Discontinuance Charges._ This is the back-end load and decreases the liquidity of the money.

**Part 2: FUND MANAGEMENT**

In older times, the insurance companies used to delegate the responsibility of fund management to the regular mutual fund companies and did not require a separate fund management team. Now they are required to do so. In most companies, the size of the investment team is small \(sometimes even 1 or 2 main persons managing the various funds\). _The quality of fund management in insurance companies is thus lower than that of the regular MF companies._ The 1.35 -1.5% FMC \(adding service tax of 12.36% means this gets translated to 1.5-1.7% net\) of most equity funds in the various Ulips is comparable with the charges in the Direct Plans of the regular equity mutual funds. Similar is the case with the debt mutual funds. If you will look in more detail, then presently the FMC of equity and longer debt Ulip funds is in general slightly lower than corresponding regular funds, while those of liquid/shorter term debt ulip funds is slightly higher.

As far as I know, _simple index funds are not available in any of the Ulips_ \(I have checked the insurance fund section of Morningstar.in and have not found any index fund\). For some people, this is a very decent option with minimum charges \(but then, Ulips are not cost-effective at all\).

**Part 3: The Various OPTIONS-**

Switching Options:

This is touted as a major benefit of Ulips. The ability to move money from equity to debt at market tops, and then move money from debt to equity at market bottoms is extremely beneficial. The only problem with that is no one has been able to do that consistently ever \(at least that is what all the major gurus say in the world all these years\). Moreover, market tops and bottoms are only apparent in the hindsight and not when they are occuring. So, if all the smart people have never been able to do that consistently, how can that be expected from a relatively unknowledgeable / less knowledgeable person buying a Ulip. It may be helpful for a very select few, but not for the 99.9% people. Also, behavioral finance tells us that if given an option like that, most people would do it in reverse, that is put money into equities near tops and put money into debt near bottoms. This is even worse than not doing anything at all.

**Part 4: ILLIQUIDITY and LOCK-IN**

If the management team of a regular mutual fund is not performing to your satisfaction, you can remove your money from them and put that amount into a different company. OR you can remove your money within the fund company. In Ulips, neither you can change the fund management company nor you can transfer away from funds available in your particular Ulip to another fund within the same company.

The surrender / discontinuance charges are extremely high. Compare this with 1-3% exit loads in various regular mutual funds.

The Illiquidity costs in a Ulip are very high WITHOUT providing a corresponding degree of benefit.

MAJOR CONS:

1. Too many charges. = Expensive and Complex.
2. Not-so-great management teams as compared to regular Fund Companies. = Suboptimal Management with comparable management expenses.
3. Very Illiquid, without providing any corresponding benefit for that illiquidity.
4. Insurance Benefit is too low for use and expensive as compared to a comparable term insurance.
5. Complex Options which in general are worse.

**What is GOOD about Ulips \(=Pros\)?**

Ulip is probably the perfect option for those people who get utterly confused and get policy-paralysis or decision paralysis \(No, this is not an uncommon thing. More and more options, after all there are thousands of mutual funds in India, just create a severe type of confusion and to prevent selection of a bad or suboptimal option, one just does not choose any\).

The advantages of Ulips are:

1. They give you an _equity based tax-free option_ in the 80C category. The other pure equity based option is ELSS \(Equity Linked Savings Scheme\). While private pension plans \(like Templeton India Pension Plan and UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Plan\) are hybrid debt oriented mutual funds with decent options\) are also there. In case, ELSS get dropped in DTC, then these will remain as the only pure equity based plans \(of course, one can choose an 80% or 50% equity option too\).
2. Although, the insurance component is inadequate in these, but as an **asset allocation instrument** \(and NOT as a market timing instrument\), this provides free transfer from equity to debt or vice versa. Free both in the sense of a number of switches every year as well as no payment is required in terms of capital gains tax as would happen if this is done outside between mutual funds or direct stocks, debt instruments, gold and cash.
3. The trigger portfolio option and automatic life-cycle based asset allocation are decent options for people who do not have the know-how or emotional execution capability. 
4. The loyalty addition is a small bonus if the requirements are fulfilled diligently.

In short, presently Ulips are mostly good in terms of behavioral financial aspects.

### Child Plan

Basic Principles:

Please check [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/wiki/strategy#wiki_basics_of_investment_strategy_plan). You need to define the following 2 things-

**1. Time horizon.** If you will not need the money in next 10 years, the equity allocation would be 80-100%. If it is 5-10 years, then equity allocation would be 50-70%. Etc. It really depends upon the age of your child and when you would approximately require that money. Say, if you child is 10 years old, and you may need the money at 18 years, then the approx. time horizon is 7-8 years. While, if the child is 3 years old, the time horizon will be 15+ years. **2. Your own investment psychology.** The above allocations are kind of aggressive. You may want to tone it down by 10-20% from equity to debt. You may want to add Gold as some percentage.

**ASSET ALLOCATION Plan to be Used and Managed:**

The baskets 1,2,3 [Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/wiki/strategy#wiki_a_simple_financial_planning_roadmap) can be used in REVERSE. This means-

1. When the goal is &gt; 3 years away, keep the money in Basket 3 in the respective equity and debt assets \(funds\). This means keep 70% into equity and 30% in long term debt.
2. When the goal is within 3 years away, transfer the money into Basket 2 type of allocation. This means start transferring money from equity to long term debt asset.
3. When the goal is within 1 year, then transfer the money from both equities and long term debt to Short Term Debt instruments.

For you as an **EXAMPLE**, if the child is 3 years and you want to invest your 50 lakhs and use it for him/her partly for undergrad admission at 18 years \(time horizon of 15 years\) and rest at 25 years \(say marriage or some other education degree\). I also assume you have a fairly conservative kind of investment method.

1. Put all the money into an equity oriented hybrid fund \(eg. Franklin Templeton Balanced / HDFC Balanced fund. Basically, any fund with a long good track record backed by a stable and good management team\), in 1 go \(or say in a short period of time of 3-6months\). Keep the money in there for next 12 years.
2. At the age of 15 years of child, you migrate part of your money from that equity-oriented fund to a long term debt fund \(in the same AMC\) as per approx. need at 18 years. Eg. If we take a 10% annual growth rate \(very conservative for this type of fund\), you will have an approx. amount of 1.5 crore. If you want 80lakhs at 18 years, you will want to shift the entire 80lakhs into the long term debt fund for 2 years or so. While the rest 70lakhs will remain in the equity hybrid fund.
3. At age 17 years, you will shift the value of those 80lakhs from the long term debt fund into a liquid/short term fund and use it whenever you need. 
4. At age 22, you shift the entire corpus from equity fund \(approx. value of 1.1 crore @ 10% CAGR\) to the long term debt fund. And at age 24, you shift it to a liquid fund/short term fund.

**VARIATIONS / MODIFICATIONS:**

1. If you have a slightly aggressive mindset \(aggressive means you can undergo the deep cut associated with equity investments\), you can use either a large cap fund \(like Franklin Blue Chip Fund or HDFC Top 200\) or a multicap fund \(like Franklin Prima Plus or HDFC Equity or DSP Equity\) instead of the equity-oriented hybrid fund mentioned above.
2. It is not necessary to use Indian instruments alone. You may want to use your own resident country's funds too. Say you are living in USA, then you can use their index funds and manage accordingly. The basic idea remains the same.
3. If you want to use a Ulip with a marketing name of “Child” placed in it \(No, there is no major difference between a non-child Ulip or a Child named Ulip except as a marketing tool\), so be it. Please do go through the [Ulip primer](http://redd.it/1kv67v) to understand them first. The shifting across equity, long term debt and short-term/liquid debt instruments would remain the same in principle. There is one added advantage in the sense that the money will remain tied into that for the entire duration, which can be a good thing.
4. It is preferable to use Direct route to AMCs if you are clear about the entire concept.
5. One can take the help of a professional financial planner too for actual management of the instruments. The entire above thing will then at least guide you.
6. If the goal is single or multiple, the above example can be modified accordingly.

_**Some Major Questions which can be asked:**_

1. _Why one equity / equity-oriented hybrid fund?_ Many people advise for 3-4 funds. The reason being a well-managed single fund gives enough diversification. Adding more funds does not increase diversification. On the other hand, multiple funds start to make the entire portfolio like a broad-market index, at the cost of active management. If you want, you can use an index fund too \(eg. IDFC Index fund is one of the lowest cost fund, while Franklin Index fund is well managed too but more expensive\). Also, in case of real reasons for changing over a fund, it is much easier to monitor and change from a single fund to another fund company rather than juggling around with 2/3/4 different companies.
2. _Can Fixed Deposits be Used?_ They can be used in the end periods. In the earlier periods, because of adverse tax treatment of these \(1. Taxable at marginal rate of tax, 2. Tax deduction at source and 3. Tax on accrual basis and not at the time of Realisation\), I do not recommend it. The corresponding debt funds are much better in this respect.
3. _Can PPF be used?_ As the debt asset part, it can be, if the goal is beyond 15 years.
