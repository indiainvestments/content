# Investment Philosophy and Strategy

## Basics of Investment Strategy Plan

### THE Basic PRINCIPLES:

1. It should be fairly **straightforward**. No need for assessment of complicated risk tolerance \(graphs/psychological tests etc\). Follow the **KISS** principle \(Keep it Simple and Stupid\).
2. Identify the objective as **Maximum Terminal Value \(Growth\) / Regular Cash Flow or a combination** of both in varying degrees.
3. Third objective is **Capital Preservation** - for those who have adequate money and now do not want to risk or have hassles. Precious FEW. Capital Preservation is also good for something like saving for a downpayment.
4. Capital preservation and Growth objectives are polar opposites and are not possible to get in a single instrument. Any instrument which claims to give both is an oxymoron like reality television, selfless politician, mature baby, etc.

### THE Basic DETERMINANTS:

1. **Time Horizon**: Select the particular appropriate time horizon. For retirement corpuses, you should consider the life expectancy of both the husband and wife plus if you want to leave for your kids. The longer the horizon, the more equity is appropriate. For say child education \(a very common goal\), initially it should be in equities and as the time for actual money comes closer, an yearly or 2-yearly change of the allocation pattern according to the graph should be done. The corollary is if you need money in the next 5 years, do not invest in equities. See [Graph](http://imgur.com/xqnlJsC)
2. **Cash Flow**: If regular income required is upto 2-3% of the total portfolio \(this is based on US data, but for our country, even 4-5% should be a safe and reasonable yield\), then an all-equity portfolio is ok. If more is required, then a blended portfolio of 70:30 or 60:40 \(equity:debt\) is advisable. Either a SWP \(Systematic Withdrawal Plan\) or periodic sellings or dividends \(from stocks\) or interest income is advisable depending upon the instruments. 
3. **Return Expectation**. It should be remembered that all asset classes except short-term debt instruments give returns in lumps. That is, for some periods the asset class will give magnificent returns for months, years to decades and at other periods, the same asset class can give flat / negative returns for similar periods.
4. **Individual Pecularity**. Best example of this is ownership of gold. Some people get a warm feeling by having this asset class in their portfolio, while others just hate having an asset class with low returns and high volatility. Although, emotional attachment to various asset classes may not the best thing to do, but if such a thing means a feeling of “_All is Well_” then such personal preferences should be followed. 

### Some important CHECKS:

1. Check availability of decent amount of **living expenses** \(usually for next 6 months\) in a liquid instrument, which canbe cash, savings account, short-term/liquid debt funds or FDs. Monthly Living expenses = your yearly expenses \(including the compulsory and the arbitrary expenses\) divided by 12.
2. Check **Insurance** requirements \(life, health, car/bike, etc\).

_Depending upon the above criteria, the appropriate allocation into stocks, debt and others should be done._

### Other important Points to remember:

People chasing heat, trying to get better returns, forget about the law of averages and invariably in-and-out relatively backward—lagging the market by going into **what used to work instead of what will work**.

No matter what portfolio you choose, realize that looking back, you will always wish that you had allocated more to what turned out, retrospectively, to be the best assets.

If you have less than 50lakh to 1 crore to invest, **buying mutual funds is cheaper**. If you’re richer, you can and should buy individual stocks or if possible, bonds \(eg SBI bonds, etc\). The more money you have, the higher the proportion that should be in underlying stocks because in large volume stocks are cheaper to own than anything including mutual funds, ETFs, or any other form of equity.

**“You must concentrate to get wealth, diversify to protect wealth.”** Those who got rich on one, two, or ten stocks are fortunate fools.

As no one equity type outperforms all of the time **diversification helps spread risk** between countries, industries, and companies.

**Always Remember You Can Be Wrong.** So you need to check things and modify accordingly.

As a general rule, it canbe assumed that about 70 percent of return in the long-term comes from asset allocation \(stocks, bonds, or cash\), and about 20 percent comes from subasset allocation—those decisions regarding types of stocks to own— whether to have large caps or mid-small caps, or foreign vs domestic, value or growth, sectors, and so on. And rest by individual stock selection. Remember, you **do not need the best** performing stocks/funds of all time, you just need to be in good ones.

### WHEN to SELL?

When your asset allocation is out of your intended variables, then you should re-balance to get it to the right proportions. This canbe done by either selling the asset which has become higher than intended or buying the asset which has become lower than intended allocation \(in case you have surplus\). Remember, don’t sell to “lock in profits.”

## A simple Financial Planning Roadmap

### **Step 1: Check Insurance requirements**

1. Check Health Insurance for you and family. If your company provides a decent amount, well and good. Otherwise, get one.
2. Do you have people who depend upon your income?
3. For most new young unmarried starters, the parents are usually not dependent on them for income \(there are exceptions\).
4. While for married people, the exceptions will be inverted. So, if someone is dependent on you for your income, get a decent life cover, preferably through an online term insurance plan \(works out the cheapest\). 
5. If both you and your spouse are working, then the overall amount of insurance requirement decreases.

   A short list of good providers is Aegon Religare, Aviva, ICICI, HDFC, in no particular order. There are others too. ~~LIC does not have, and most probably will not have an online plan \(don't ask me why\)~~ LIC also has now \(since May 2014\).

### **Step 2: Check Level of Emergency / Contingency Funds \(Basket 1\)**

Start putting money in a short-term debt fund / liquid fund / FDs partly and cash in savings account partly. Amount should be decent enough to manage your next 6 months discretionary and non-discretionary “normal” expenses. Also, every 6 months to 1 year, try to increase this amount little by little. In case you use it for any reason, then fill it up ASAP.

### **Step 3: Short-term goals coming up in next 2-3 years \(Basket 2\)**

Examples like holidays, birthday celebrations, school fees, downpayment for home, etc. The idea is that you cannot take risk with the principal amount, but still you will be happy in having a better return than keeping cash in savings account. Good instruments for this are short-term and income debt funds. Plus RD / FD for people having otherwise either 0 or 10% income tax slabs.

### **Step 4: Longer Term Goals \(Basket 3\)**

All your long term goals including child education, marriage, retirement, foreign holidays 10 years down the line, etc come into this Basket.

Identify the combination and the allocation percentages of various asset classes, according to this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/171p5h/basics_of_investment_strategy_plan/).

A good \(minimum, I would say\) start is to have a 50:50 equity-debt allocation. For less conservative, this canbe modulated to 60:40 or 70:30. For very aggressive, it can even be increased to 80:20. Identify a single diversified equity fund for the equity allocation. Later on, you can start adding more funds, or direct stocks or international stock/funds, as per knowledge increase and comfort zone. Identify a single decent debt fund \(I will stress on having a debt fund, rather than a PPF because of the latter's illiquidity, but YMMV\). Endowment / money-back policies, PPF, PF, NSC, etc also come under this basket only because of their lock-ins.

**Periodic Reviews:**

1. Every month, quarter, 6 monthly or yearly, sit and check the various goals under Baskets 2 and 3.
2. Make accordingly provisions for those requirements.
3. Check the valuations of Basket 3 assets. See if they have strayed much more than your original intended allocation pattern.
4. Eg, you started with 60:40, but currently because the markets have performed well, the percentages have skewed to 70:30. Then you need to either put money slowly into the lesser asset \(in this case, debt has gone down, so add more money to your debt asset instruments.
5. On the other hand, if markets have gone down, then you will need to put money into the equity portion. Doing it slowly month by month is not a bad idea at all. The other option of shifting money from debt fund to equity or vice versa is ok too but that just increases the tax liability \(in most cases\). And if you are using PPF / endowment policies, then this is not possible too.

In general, your money management should work in this way:

1. Basket 1- sufficient/insufficient. If it is insufficient, next month's income goes into filling it or you shift money from basket 2 to basket 1. Otherwise, next step.
2. Basket 2 – sufficient/insufficient. If if it is insufficient, then fill this up back again either using income or from basket 3 funds. Otherwise, next step.
3. Basket 3 – check asset allocation values. Balance by adding to the lower allocation asset Till the time they are upto the desired values. This may take months of investing in equity followed by months into debt or equal amounts in both as per different conditions.
4. Whenever, there is an acute short-fall, then money should go from Basket 2 &gt; Basket 1. OR Basket 3 &gt; Basket 2. If you are feeling the need of getting money from Basket 3 &gt; Basket 1 \(in simpler terms, money from longer term goals / equity for day-to-day expenses, then something is seriously wrong and you need to correct course\).

**What not to do:**

1. Monitoring the performance of your equity fund month over month. Checking their star rating. If you have selected a decently performing fund, then you do not need to change the fund as per its star rating.
2. Selling Equity funds/stocks, because they have moved up, even though, your intended asset allocation is within the initial limits.

A **simple example** of Selection using Direct Investing in a single AMC with a netbanking facility bank.

Basket 1 – Liquid fund + Cash

Basket 2 – Income Opportunities fund

Basket 3 – Dynamic Bond fund and a plain vanilla multicap / flexicap equity fund.

Additional benefits:

1. Lesser expense ratio for all funds by use of Direct Investing.
2. Easy switching of money from one basket to another.
3. Easy buy / redemption using netbanking.

## Various types of Risks in Investments

A common definition used is 'Risk is the uncertainty that an investment will earn its expected rate of return.” It includes both Upside and Downside Risk. Although, we like the Upside Risk \(return much greater than expected\), we abhor the Downside risk. One needs to understand that both are sides of the same coin and mostly cannot be separated. If you want an instrument which can give / has given higher returns than expected in the past, then in future, the opposite can happen too.

There are plenty of places in which one can find the various types and details of various types of Risks. References:

1. [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/finra-series-6/evaluation-customers/types-investment-risks.asp)
2. [Franklin Templeton Investor Education](https://www.franklintempleton.com/retail/pages/generic_content/education/fin_basic/understand_risk.jsf)

I will just mention about the common ones from our perspective.

### **I. Inflation Risk or Purchasing-power Risk**

This is probably one of the biggest “hidden” risk faced by us. I have made a small [table](http://imgur.com/dfcMsgk) which shows the official data of inflation \(This is made by using Cost Inflation Index values in the last 30 years, which itself is calculated by multiplying 0.75 and the average consumer price index or CPI\). Also, the rolling 5 year and 10 year inflation rates are also given. In my opinion, it would not be wrong to assume that even these values are smaller than the real inflation rates suffered by us, but then that is a separate discussion. Some main points, during the entire 90's, the average inflation was 10+%, while in 00's, it was moderate in the mid-00s and is again trending up.

What does this mean? In the simplest words, Inflation is a negative debt which is superimposed on all types of investment instruments. For under-the-mattress cash, a 10% inflation means, the value of Rs 100 becomes 90 in one year, in terms of real value, even though, the actual value is 100 only. Progressing this over 7 years, it will make the real value 48, while the nominal value will still remain 100.

Next, if you keep this in a savings account, then after one year, this value will become 104 \(assuming 4% interest rate\), but the real value will be 94 \(in simple maths\). After 7 years, it will have a real value of 65, but a nominal value of 128. This actually needs to be hammered in. Agents, advisors, media, etc show us the value of 128 and tell us how good that is, and how 'surely' you will get that nominal value \(of course, there is least risk in a savings account\), but in actual values, you have lost 35% of your purchasing power.

Higher up, you Save \(invest is a wrong word there. Even GOI only tells us that we have a great savings rate of 30-32%, and not Investment Rate, so....\) in a FD which presently is giving you 9% return. Amazing right. But if you see, the inflation rate is on an average 10%. So, even with 7 year FD, your real value will be 93, while the nominal value will be 145.

In short, the real return = nominal return – inflation. And this real return is what we should assume in our calculations. For long period of time, equities and real-estate tend to provide above-inflation returns. Whether this will hold for future, we do not know. But this is certain, most debt products and cash-equivalents \(=the traditional risk free products\) always lose in terms of real return.

### **II. Systematic Risk or Market Risk**

This is an inherent risk of the asset class and cannot be removed by Diversification. This is the value which is mostly perceived by general public. FDs are safe = the systematic risk of loss of nominal value in FDs is very less. While Equities are not safe / risky = the systematic risk of loss of nominal value in equities is high. \(Although, if 5-year and 7 year rolling returns are calculated, then FDs lose their real-return while equities score high in both real-return and nominal returns\).

How to control Systematic Risk ? This can be controlled by using different assets which are not correlated with each other. So, when a portfolio is allocated across non-correlated assets, a systematic event may cause some assets to go down, while others may be unaffected, or even continue to grow.

### **III. Unsystematic risk**

This risk is related to concentration in one stock or bond or company. Like buying a single stock exposes you to this kind of risk. This risk canbe managed by diversifying across different stocks or different bonds.

### **IV. Liquidity Risk**

This is another “hidden” risk, which most people do not realise. Illiquidity means loss of flexibility. The costs of illiquidity are quiet. The extra yield seems free until there is a need for ready cash, whether to spend or to take advantage of investment bargains. There are all manner of illiquid investments offering yield, but almost all of them lock the investor up for a time. Prominent among them are all non-term insurances and FMPs. FDs have a built in illiquidity in the form of lower interest rate plus some penalty, in case of early withdrawal. Any product which guarantees you something will have high and/or long surrender charges.

_Point to Remember:_ Never trust an insurance agent who is receiving a large commission to sell you an annuity. If they won’t disclose the commission, know that it is roughly the size of the initial surrender charge. Invariably all insurance policies never give the first year premium, in cases of early surrender.

## Asset Rebalancing

[Original Post](http://redd.it/1pdwnt)

### Main Ideas:

1. In a well-diversified portfolio, the individual investments are expected to generate a certain rate of return based upon their characteristics and risk profiles.
2. The returns of different asset classes in a short-term cannot be known in advance. And the markets \(both debt and equity\) can have significant volatility so as to throw the investors off track. In other words, the short-term performances of assets are Unknown unknowns.
3. Over longer periods of time, it has been shown that Regression to the mean occurs for the major asset classes. In Jason Zweig's words - “Periods of above-average performance are inevitably followed by below-average returns, and bad times inevitably set the stage for surprisingly good performance.” [Link](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/06/28/the-intelligent-investor-saving-investors-from-themselves/).
4. By rebalancing, we are actually selling the asset class which has gone up, while buying the one which has gone down. It is the idea of Buying Low, and Selling High. Although, in practice, it is quite difficult to do for most people.

### Methods of Rebalancing:

**1. Calender Method** – You do your Asset rebalancing on a monthly, quarterly, yearly, 2/5 yearly basis. Or you do it daily \(David Swensen used to do it daily in his Yale Endowment portfolio, largely because that portfolio did not incur any taxes\). There have been few studies which have shown that the frequency of rebalancing, as such, does not have any statistically significant effect over the overall return of the portfolio, provided you do the rebalancing. \(I cannot get reference for that right now\).

**2. Percentage Method** – In this, whenever the particular asset goes beyond a set percentage value, the portfolio is rebalanced regardless of the last time it was done.

Another classification can be:

**1. By Buying alone** – For people who are in period of accumulation / investing money, the balancing can be done by investing amounts in which different amounts are invested into the different assets so as to bring the total amounts in the desired percentages, without ever needing to sell from one. This works best in terms of taxation, because there are no realized gains.

**2. By buying and selling** – This works for people who have set themselves multiple fixed SIPs. Every year or so, they check the various asset values, and then sell from the higher value asset class to buy from the lower value asset class \(or by simple switching, if that is possible\).

**3. By selling** – This works for people who are in the Income generation group and who have to sell assets to get regular income. These people can sell from the higher value asset to rebalance towards their desired asset allocation.

Which is better? Statistically, none. It just depends on the individual investor on what is most comfortable to him. The best frequency is the one which one can do consistently and which hurts the minimum in terms of taxation.

Personally, I use the Buying alone and Calender method.

## Lumpsum or SIP/STP

[Original Post and discussion](http://redd.it/1q8dwj)

This is quite confusing to many people, since the finance world touts SIP \(Dollar Cost Averaging in foreign terms\) as the best way to invest.

Definitions:

**SIP \(Systematic Investment Plan\)** = one invests a fixed amount of money at a regular interval \(daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly\). In short, it is transfer of money from cash to a particular asset \(mutual fund / direct equity called the DIY-SIP or other such names\).

**STP \(Systematic Transfer Plan\)** = one switches from one mutual fund to another at regular interval, if the money is already with the AMC \(asset management company\).

**Lumpsum** = The investment of the whole lot of money into an asset.

_Basic Guiding Principle:_ The overall average return of various asset classes vary. In the long term, the cash and cash-equivalents produce low but fixed returns, while the equity assets produce high returns with volatility \(in most cases\).

Eg. 1:

You have got 10 lakhs, and your investment horizon is &gt;10 years. So should you put your money in

1. 10L in an equity fund \(or equity-oriented hybrid fund\) on day 0. OR
2. Put your money in a short-term debt / liquid fund and start a STP into the equity fund at monthly \(120 installments\) / yearly \(10 installments\) intervals.
3. Keep your money in your bank account and start SIP into the equity fund at 120 monthly / 10 yearly intervals.

Since the investment horizon is quite long, it is much better if one chooses option 1 \(whatever be the sensex levels\). Option 3 will give you lesser overall return, because the long term return from the cash component will be quite less than of the diversified equity asset class.

There is one [study](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/InvResDollarCostAve) released by Vanguard which supports the above. The PDF is linked in that.

Eg 2.

You do not have 10L, but can invest at a rate of 8k per month \(Total principal amount 10L, over 10 years\). So should you, since lumpsum is better than SIP,

1. Start putting your money into your account / liquid fund over all those 10 years, and then invest lumpsum at the end of 10 years, OR
2. You should start putting the money directly into Equity as a regular SIP.

The answer is obviously 2, since you will not be missing out on all those 10 years of equity returns.

TL;DR, if you have money to invest for a long term, put that money into a diversified equity asset ASAP. If you have got lumpsum \(eg, bonus money or tax refund\), then invest lumpsum. If you have regular stream, then invest at a regular interval.
