## Primer on Retirement Planning

[Original Post and Discussion](https://redd.it/1ye18j)

So, you probably groaned in your head when you read the title. Retirement planning is not something that you feel is something that deserves your attention because 'Hey, my career started quite recently! I have a long way to go before I start worrying about things like retirement, right?'

Wrong! Now I am not asking you to worry about it. But through this post, I will hopefully be able to teach you why you should do it whilst explaining the different options that you have out there.

According to a MetLife India Insurance survey results published in 2008\(kinda old but I doubt if much has changed\), over 80% Indian employees have done no retirement planning independent of any mandatory government plans. For comparison, those numbers stood at 58%, 46% and 31% for Australia, US and the UK respectively.

In India, while almost three out of four employees \(71%\) say they are “concerned” about outliving retirement money, only one out of every three \(35%\) say they have taken steps to determine retirement needs; only 20% say they have done actual planning for retirement.

Personally, I think it's a cultural thing. My brother affectionately calls his first born as 'Retirement Plan A'. Our parents/uncles/aunts did support our grandparents in some way or the other. You probably already know that it's a bit of a struggle to support our own parents. It's rather easy to extrapolate that we shouldn't expect much from our children. I mean, I consider myself to be fairly 'well brought up' but when it comes to having the discipline to be regular in sending money back home, turns out, I am a selfish douchecanoe. And if there's one thing I've learnt on reddit, it's that I am 'not the only one'.

Combine this with the fact that our country's social security is system is kinda non-existent, you and your spouse\(if you're into that\) are going to have to be the ones who'll have to look after yourselves. You probably have a lot of other goals that you want to plan about \(like buying a house or car or preparing for your children's education, or going on a world tour, etc\) but most financial planners will agree that retirment planning should be your top most priority.

Thanks to the time value of money concept, the sooner you start, the better it will be.

TL;DR:- THOU SHALL PLAN FOR RETIREMENT OR THOU SHALL REPENT!

Like all my previous posts, I am going to assume that you are not a financially savvy person and am going to try and break it down for you.

### **Question no.1 How can I know how much money I'll be needing post retirement?**

To be honest, there's no accurate answer to that question. You'll have to make a whole lot of assumptions not only about yourself but also about the state of the economy. But the lack of accuracy shouldn't put you off from doing what you can right now. As they say in /r/running, 'When you've just started, it doesn't matter how much distance you run, you're still doing better than the millions of guys who are just sitting on their couch.'

Okay, that might have been a little too dramatic, but you get the point. Moving on.

Visualise yourself at the time of your retirement. I know it's tough but just do it. What is your average day going to look like? Resist the temptation to wonder if they've invented Star Trek style transports. A good way of doing this is to look at your retired parents and grandparents. What are their lives like? My folks spend a whole lot on groceries, medical bills and people's weddings and funerals. They travel every couple of months to visit their children or host their visits. The question is, are they spending more money than they used to when they weren't retired or are they spending less money?

More often than not, you'll find that their expenses have actually reduced since their pre-retirement era. Simply because, they don't go out partying every weekend, they no longer need to spend on their children, they no longer think that over-priced coffee is the besht, they no longer feel the need to watch movies within the first week of it's release and so on and so forth.

But then again, this differs from person to person. Some people assume that their post retirement household living expenses will only be about 70%-80% of their pre-retirement household expenses. Not a bad assumption IMO.

So, going with this assumption, suppose you currently spend about Rs. 20,000/- per month on stuff like groceries and utilities, etc, assuming you'll only need 80% of your expenses, when you retire about 30 years from now, you'll be spending about Rs. 16,000/- only, right?

Wrong again! _"Accept certain inalienable truths...prices will rise, politicians will Philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders."_ \(In case you are wondering why that sounds familiar, it's from the legendary song called Sunscreen by Baz Luhrmann\)

What I am trying to say is, you will have to factor in INFLATION^INFLATION^INFLATION^INFLATION. The amount of stuff you can buy for Rs.100/- today will be a lot less 30 years from now. Inflation Rate in India averaged 9.83 Percent from 2012 until 2014, reaching an all time high of 11.16 Percent in November of 2013 and a record low of 7.55 Percent in January of 2012. Ceteris Paribus, let us assume that over the next 30 years the average inflation rate is 8%, then, to maintain the same level of expenses of Rs. 20,000 per month, 30 years from now, you will need to spend about Rs. 2,00,000/- PER MONTH. \(You can do the math yourself using the FV formula in MS Excel. _Rate_ will be the expected annual inflation rate, _nper_ will be the number of years left to your retirement, _PV_ or present value will be your present expenses\).

I am not sure what salary hikes are like in your industry/company, but for people like me who are in banking, if you are an average to above average performer, assuming you work continuously, chances are that your salary will rise in tandem with the inflation. In which case, you don't have to panic as much. People tend to shift jobs every few years and get an average hike of about 25% at every jump. This will hopefully keep your income above the inflation line. But let us assume that you are an average joe and that you won't be jumping around much. How the hell are you going to maintain your lifestyle once you are retired? Plan my friend. Plan!

You need to figure out your required retirement corpus and start building towards it. Assuming you have a life expectancy of 75 years, this corpus of yours should be able to support you for approximately 20 years past your retirement.

I hope I didn't scare you. Did I scare you? I did want to scare you but just a little bit. Relax people, there's a whole bunch of retirement planning products out there and your-friendly-neighbourhood-aspiring-financial-planner is going to break them down for you. Before we move on to that, if you want to further discuss exactly how to arrive at your retirement corpus, make posts explaining your specific scenarios. Use throwaways if you are uncomfortable with sharing your details. We'll discuss your case as a community.

### **Question 2: What kind of retirement planning products are out there?**

In the interest of time and space, I am going to be very brief about each one of these. If you want further clarity on any of these, feel free to comment below or start a new thread. Also, I have left out the usual suspects like FDs, Mutual Funds, Insurance policies, etc.

Which of these products or a combination thereof are best suited for you is something you are going to have to figure out yourself. Preferably, in consultation with a professional. Also, make sure that you keep reviewing your choices periodically to ensure that they are in sync with your expectations.

Due to character restrictions and to facilitate future discussions, I am going to post each product as a separate comment.

P.S:- The rates and rules are as current as I could find, if you find that the information provided is incorrect/outdated, feel free to point them out.

#### **A. PUBLIC PROVIDENT FUND \(PPF\)**

[There is a **Separate Page** for PPF](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/wiki/ppf)

The PPF is a government backed, long term small savings scheme which was initially started by the Government because it wanted to provide retirement security to self employed individuals and workers in the unorganized sector.

#### **B. New Pension Scheme**

New Pension System \(NPS\) is a defined contribution based pension system launched by Government of India with an aim to provide old-age security coverage and pension for all citizens of India.  The scheme provides investors an option to avail reasonable market based returns over long term. Periodic contributions will get invested through PFRDA appointed Pension Fund Managers \(PFMs\) in a combination of investment avenues as per the choice of investor.

_Features_

It's got two tiers. Tier-I is the main pension account and is non-withdrawable. Tier-II is a voluntary savings facility which is withdrawable.

_Tenure:_ Till you become 60 years old.

_Interest Rates:_ Not applicable. Returns are Market based. NPS offers the investor an option to decide an asset allocation between Equity Instruments, Corporate Bonds and Government Securities, with up to 50% exposure to Equity instruments.

Tier I:

The contribution made by a National Pension System subscriber in Tier I scheme is deductible from the total income under Section 80CCD of the Income Tax Act. Like wise, the contribution made by the employer for the employee in Tier I of National Pension System is also deductible under Section 80CCD. However, the aggregate deduction under Section 80C, 80CCC and 80CCD is fixed at Rs.1 lakh.

So, if the NPS subscriber already has other eligible deductions such as LIC premium, PPF, bank or NSC deposits, ELSS etc., under Section 80C, 80CCC and Section 80CCD., deduction allowed under Section 80CCD in respect of National Pension System may not be of much use as the overall limit of savings eligible for deduction is pegged at Rs. 1 lakh.

_Loan Facility?_:

Tier I: Nope.

Tier II: Nope.

_Withdrawal Facility?_

Tier II: Yes. Limitless.

_How to?_

Six designated Pension Fund Managers \(PFMs\) have been appointed who would be responsible for investing the funds and generating returns from them. An investor would have the liberty to choose or change their fund manager if so required:

#### **D. Employees Provident Fund**

You are probably already in on this. Read on to understand how it works.

There are several crucial aspects about EPF that many would not know. For instance, there are two elements to EPF - EPF and Employees' Pension Scheme \(EPS\). The 12 per cent employee contribution goes to EPF. However, the employer's contribution is divided in 8.33 per cent that goes in EPS, subject to a maximum of Rs 541 a month. The rest goes to EPF.

_Features_

_Interest rate_: Interest rate on EPF deposits for 2013-14 is 8.75% \(as announced on Jan 13, 2014\). The compound interest is provided only on EPF part. The EPS part \(8.33% out of 12% contribution from your employer\) does **not** get any interest.

_Tenure:_ You contribute till you retire and then get the pension. An employee is eligible to earn pension only on attaining 58 years of age, after completing 10 years of service. Or, on having contributed to it for 20 years. In either case, the pensionable service or number of years of contribution are increased by two years. For instance, one has attained 58 years and contributed for 25 years. Then, the pensionable service will be taken as 27 years. Or, if contributed for 20 years, then also it will be considered as 27 years.

_Maturity type?:_ Lumpsum/Pension

_Minimum and Maximum Investment:_ You can always invest more than 12% of your basic salary in EPF which is called VPF. In this case the excess amount will be invested in EPF and you will keep on getting the interest, but the employer is not supposed to match your contribution. He will just invest upto maximum of 12% of your basic, not more than that.

_Tax Benefit?:_ Yes. The employer contribution is exempt from tax, while an employee’s contribution is taxable but eligible for deduction under Section 80C of Income tax Act. The money which you initially invest in EPF, the interest you earn and, finally the money you withdraw after a specified period \(5 years\), are all exempt from income tax. Withdrawal from an EPF amount is subject to tax if it is carried out within 5 years of employment with the same employer. However, if you have not worked for at least five years with the same employer but the EPF has been transferred to the new employer, it is not taxed.

_NRI Friendly?:_ Nope. It is applicable to employees working in India for Indian firms wonly.

_Loan facility?:_ Nope. But you can withdraw.

_Withdrawal facility?:_ Yes. But only in the following conditions:

1. Marriage or education of self, children or siblings
2. Medical treatment for Self or family \(spouse, children, dependent parents\)
3. Repay a housing loan for a house in the name of self, spouse or owned jointly.
4. Alterations/repairs to an existing home for house in the name of self, spouse or jointly.
5. Construction or purchase of house or flat/site or plot for self or spouse or joint ownership

These are all subject to various unique conditions each.

_How to?:_ Well, your HR will take care of that.

## **Why You should not Opt for a Readymade Pension Plan**

One of my friends recently met a smart young supposedly “IRDA approved financial consultant” who gave him an overview of investing into a **retirement plan** \(and which was not a Ulip, in his words\). I was merely an observer.

He gave him nice descriptions about the plan, and how that will be the best thing for his retirement and how he can then enjoy the best things in life automatically \(only and only\) if he invests in that plan. Awesome idea. Their fund management team had worked fabulously, and provided 15% returns on balanced funds \(balanced funds = funds which can invest in both equities and debt\). And implied in the response was that they will continue to do that for all the coming years. Great thing indeed again.

My friend asked “How much will this cost to me?”. Sir, around 2.5% are the total management charges. Hmm. That sounds decent.

Next question “How much will I have to invest?”. Sir, if you can tell us how much will you need, then we can tell you. Or you can mail us directly about that and we can get back to you with specific numbers. Fair enough.

After the talk, my friend asked for the brochure, and asked them to wait for his call after a week. In any investment plan, delay the hurry.

So here comes my **analysis from the Brochure**.

“In this policy, the investment risk in Investment Portfolio is Borne by the Policyholder”. In big bright bold letters. _Inf= Ok. Good, they had told him but with an oral implication of 15% returns._

Then comes a slew of good things and offers. Blah Blah.

“In this plan, your premium, net of premium allocation charges, will be invested in an **exclusive Pension Fund**. At the end of the policy term, you will receive higher of the following – Fund Value or Assured Benefit of 101% of all premiums \(including top-up premiums\). _Inf= So, the guarantee is what one pays over all the years. And they will add 1% to the total principal and return it as the guarantee. Even this is not free and comes with its own charge._

Your maturity benefit will be used to provide you with **post-retirement income** i.e. an annuity which you have to purchase from us. _Oh._ The advisors had already told him that he can get UPTO 33% of that amount as cash, while rest has to be used for annuity or have to pay tax on that.

If there is unfortunate demise of the policyholder, then the nominee will get the **death benefit**. This is Higher of 1. Fund value or 2. Total premiums paid plus interest @ 6% per year. And of course, if the fund value is less than the alternative total value, then the company will deduct mortality charges, based upon the age of the policy holder \(more the age, more will be the mortality charges\).

Then there is a slew of different options, most of which I do not think I have any idea. Eg:

1. Plan your maturity age. How is one supposed to plan the retirement age, will it be 55,60,65 or 70.
2. Retirement needs. Which are extremely difficult to assess. Too many variables.

Investment Fund- The fund in this case is a single fund, which is a **balanced fund with a max of equity of 60%**. Actually, this is not a bad option for a short-to-medium term \(say 8-10 years\). But for a period of 20-30 years, this restriction is a bad option.

There is no information regarding the investment team \(who are they, how many, how long is their experience, etc. How has the performance been\).

Then there are standard clauses regarding the investment fund and benefits \(which I have already enumerated above\). One important thing is again, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder \(which means, if the fund value goes down, ultimately it is the policy holder's responsibility only\).

Some special considerations:

**Policy Discontinuance**- Upto 5 years, if the policy is not paid continuously, the money will get transferred to a Discontinued Policy fund, which will get a princely savings account interest rate of the biggest bank of India \(SBI\) – currently 4% - minus the discontinued policy fund charge of 0.5%. Amazing.

After 5 years, if one does not pay, then it will get an automatic surrender and the fund value will be paid back.

**At Maturity:** Apart from 1/3 of the fund value taxfree cash, I will HAVE to buy an annuity from this company \(or probably from other companies too\). The various annuity plans have different monthly/ yearly amounts depending upon the prevailing long term interest rates, type of annuity and the company's analysis of the policyholder's longetivity \(again too many variables to even give a decent approximation\). So, even if they look lip-smacking \(7-9%\) at current rates, they may not be so 10-20 years down the line. Let us analyze this a little further. A 7-9% annuity rate may appear to be good, but if you realise that the amount provided is FIXED for the term of annuity, then that means at an inflation rate of 7-10%, this FIXED amount will start to look small within 5-10 years. And I am not even speaking about 20-30 years down the line. The purchasing power will diminish rapidly later on and this supposedly decent amount will look like a small amount later on.

**A Look at Charges:**

1. Premium Allocation Charges. 2.5%. So out of every 100, 2.5 will be cut and never invested at all. Why? Do not know. Compare this to normal mutual funds – zero. Of course, this charge will continue for 1-10 years, and 11th year onwards, they will give me 102.5% of my premium. Which means they will add an extra 2.5% and invest that amount. Good. But a 2.5% cut in first year does not match with a 2.5% addition in later years. Then some plans are said to be for 10 years only. Even the top up premiums get a 1% deduction. Absolutely horrible.
2. Policy Admin Charges. 0.4% per month of Premium. So that means, about 5% \(12x0.4=4.8\) of the premium will be deducted in administering my policy over and above the normal fund charges.
3. Mortality Charges- If the fund value is less than the alternative mortality benefit \(premiums @ 6% value\), then a corresponding amount of life cover will be given and the appropriate mortality charges will be deducted. 
4. Investment Guarantee Charge- An additional 0.4% per annum for guarantee. This is the charge for providing a guarantee of 101%. In all, a very bad charge. 

Some of the charges are subject to alteration too with prior approval of IRDA.

Service Tax is another charge which is applicable to all charges \(it really is a charge by the government, and not really the insurer's fault\).

**Take Away Points:**

1. A pension plan is a complicated product with lot of ifs and buts during the buying period. And mostly lot of disappointments for later years.
2. Only 1/3 is taxfree in hand at the time of maturity. 
3. Rest has to be used to buy an annuity. \(Alternative is create a corpus other than a pension plan, and then use it to buy the annuity, if you really find the annuity options good at the time of purchase.
4. There are a lot of bad charges, which really do not give any decent advantages.
5. In this particular plan, since there are no alternative funds, one does not even get the “supposed benefit” of switching from equity to debt. \(I must say, even that benefit is really very difficult to make use of. Invariably, you will tend to shift from equity to debt at low levels and vice versa\). 
6. Any guarantee will be charged. Any risk will be charged. Nothing is free. One needs to understand whether that guarantee / risk deferment is really worth the money or not.

Two advantages:

1. It is probably good for people who do not understand the basics of investing and want an emotional need to be satisfied by having a pension plan in their “portfolio”. And who have so much money, that even if their money is kept as cash, it can serve them easily.
2. This plan is still better than the completely opaque non-Ulip retirement plans.

I have specifically taken up the HDFC Life Pension Super Plus plan in this case. But, the basics of analysis will be same all across.

**Addendum:** Annuity is a plan, usually by insurance companies, in which you pay a single premium and then the company in turn pays monthly/yearly amounts to you for the rest of your life \(single life annuity\), or your life as well your spouse's life term \(joint life annuity\). This amount is mostly based on the long term interest rates & life expectancy of you \(and your spouse\). So if you are already very old, you will get more income, while if the long term interest rates are low, you will get less.

There is an option of increasing amounts \(usually 1-3% per year\).

There are some other options like cash refund \(option to buy back\), a fixed term of payments \(like 10 years or so\), etc.

check out [LIC's plan](http://www.licindia.in/jeevan_akshay_plan_009_features.htm) for more ideas.

## Studies of Long Term Portfolios and Retirement Withdrawal Rate Suggestions

This analysis gives you a basic idea about the historical and current perspectives of institutions which manage money on a large scale. And because the world economy is increasingly getting unified \(as compared to past\), these ideas will be applicable on a principle basis. Hence, this idea is important as far as the basic strategy is concerned.

However, how it applies tactically in individual cases and in an Indian context will be different.

eg. many people think that since we can get 8-9% tax-free and guaranteed on govt securities \(govt backing is as close to guarantee as one can get\), we need not think about all this 3.5-4.0% withdrawal rates. But they forget the basic difference between a nominal return of 8-9% versus a inflation-adjusted real return. After 10 years, the same 8-9% nominal return will not be sufficient AT ALL in most cases. A lot of pension plans also show you similar things and make the income _look big_ but it is not so.

It really is a tough thing when you realise in these examples that even the best of the institutions with tremendous money power \(and knowledge\) cannot have a very high sustainable rate.

The various endowment reports studied:

**I. Nobel Prize Committee Financial management** [Link](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/finan-manag.html)

The real return \(above inflation\) expected from the fund is 3.5% \(while they plan to use 3.0% at least yearly\). They have considered an allocation of 55% \(+/- 10\) to equities, 20% \(+/-10\) to fixed income and 25%\(+/-10\) to alternative investments \(including hedge funds and real estate\).

**II. Yale Endowment Portfolio Management** [Link](http://investments.yale.edu/images/documents/Yale_Endowment_12.pdf)

They expect a real return of 4.5%. The main difference from above is that they indulge in lot of alterative assets and active management strategies \(with alpha\). A good case in point was in 2008 period, when they went too far in their strategy and were having a negative 1.5-2% in cash, and suddenly during the crisis, they were in a severe bind. So now they have corrected that part and keep a decent amount of cash with them.

**III. Norwegian govt sovereign fund** [Analysis Link](http://abnormalreturns.com/focus-on-norway-not-cyprus/) They expect a return of 4% and unlike the endowment funds, they do not put anything into alternative asset classes. They follow simple 60:40 rule with regular rebalancing and following cost-effective strategies \(read passive investing\).

More about Withdrawal Rates on this [page](http://www.wealthmgt.com/accumulation_distribution.htm)

Many of the online calculators have used 4% as a reasonable withdrawal rate for 30 year periods using Monte-carlo calculators. However, based on various rolling data periods of actual market returns for US equity markets, a 4% withdrawal rate will not sustain for 30 year periods in 30-40% cases \(whatever be the asset allocation\). At 5% withdrawal rate, the failure rate over 30 year periods increases to 40-55%. While at 3.5%, it falls to &lt;10% unless one is in 100% bonds or 100% equities.

_Why Monte-carlo is not the right thing?_ because the random number generation in those simulations is normal distribution curve related \(while the actual returns are never like those\).

_Why US equity market data?_ Since that data is long and reasonably good and since it is the most important economy in the increasingly globalised world, it mirrors capital markets to a large extent.

**Basket 1**. First ascertain, how much money you need in next 2 years \(2 years expense including discretionary and non-discretionary\). Put this amount partly in Bank account \(obviously with an ATM/debit card\), and rest in short-term / ultra-short term debt mutual funds.

**Basket 2**. Now ascertain an approximate amount of money needed in next 3-4 years \(This is just an approximation again\). Keep this amount into a dynamic bond or income fund.

**Basket 3**: The rest of the money, [keep in different assets](https://redd.it/3snc1j). For simplicity sake, use a 50:50 equity / debt allocation and keep money in a single debt income fund and a single well-managed conservative equity fund.

**Methodology:**

1. Use SWP \(Systematic Withdrawal Plan\) to withdraw the monthly requirement from the short-term fund \(Basket 1\).
2. Every year, recheck things on the same basis, namely, ascertain next 2 years, then additional next 3 years and then the Basket 3 allocation level. Use switch to remove money from baskets 2/3 into basket 1, as per the requirements.
3. If the allocation levels in basket 3 are way out of proportion, remove money from the higher allocation amount into the other baskets or into the other fund. 

Eg 1, you started with 50 L in basket 3 and allocation 25L each in a debt and an equity fund. In next year, your amounts changed to 30L in equity \(an increase of 20%\), while the debt fund increased to 27L \(8%\). Plus, you have a deficit of 2L in baskets 1 and 2 according to your calculations. In that case, you should remove 2L from the equity fund into baskets 1 and 2 as per deficits.

Eg 2: If next year, the equity fund decreases by 20% to 20L, while the debt fund increases to 27L, and you require 2L again. In that case, you remove 2L from debt fund, and you transfer 2-3 L from debt fund to equity fund to re-balance the 50:50.

**Why not a Pension Fund?**

1. Because of numerous charges, which are not beneficial. Check Section 2. After all, you just need to invest into a debt or an equity fund, which are easily available elsewhere.
2. The lock-in of pension funds does not add into the overall return. On the contrary, the loss of liquidity in such plans is a double whammy. You lose liquidity as well as returns. 
3. At the end of these plans, you have to buy annuity from the insurance providers, otherwise, you risk paying a lot of taxes \(At present, 33% is tax-free as cash to you, but the rest is not tax-free unless you buy an annuity\).

**Why not opt for an Annuity?**

_Annuity_ is basically a way of converting a corpus of money into regular income for the retirement years. There are different types of annuities available, though, the variations are very less compared to those available in the west.

Additional Points:

1. Annuities are taxable. They are treated as income and accordingly, applicable taxes as per the amount.
2. Presently, they invest mostly in debt products \(probably, since the structure of most of these products is not transparent\). The rates are anywhere from 5-9.5% depending upon various options like return of premium, joint life plans, etc.
3. Biggest problem is 'the annuity amount is fixed'. So, x amount maybe good for next 1-2 years, but after 5 years, the same x amount will be inadequate, assuming you want to maintain the same lifestyle.

**Additional advantages of DIY Pension Plan?**

1. The use of SWP in a debt plan is treated in a better manner than other options \(including senior citizen FDs\).

2. The presence of Equities should help in having above inflation returns over a longer time frame.
3. The entire corpus remains in your name, and it can be transferred to whoever you want \(children, grandchildren, etc\). And not to the insurance company.
4. Keeps the liquidity and flexibility of your own money in your hands. In case of emergency, you can use your money. 

**What are the Disadvantages of a DIY Pension Plan?**

1. It makes you responsible to maintain the entire stuff.
2. It is a bit more complicated to understand and do, particularly for elderly. So, mostly this will either require some assistance or a web-savvy elderly person.
3. If one starts looking at individual components of basket 2 and 3, then it can happen that in some years, the valuations of those individual funds can change drastically, mostly of the equity fund, and that can create emotional issues and lead to panic selling. Also, the individual funds may not be or remain 5 star funds in very month/ quarter or year. One just needs the funds to give you proper exposure to the desired asset class, with reasonable management fees, and with a decent performance \(which may or may not be the best performance\).
