# Time Value of Money

This is one of the most important concepts in finance. It implies that rupees paid or received _in the future_ are different from the rupees paid or received _today._ It is easier to understand that ₹1000 in your wallet today is worth more than ₹1000 in your wallet 5 years in the future. This is because you can invest that ₹1000 in your savings account and earn interest for 5 years and get more than ₹1000 5 years later.

There are 2 types of calculations which answer 2 different questions:

1. What will be the value of an investment \(or a series of investments\) after a certain period of time? This question asks about the _Future Value._ Basically how much will be the _Future_ value of the investment. Eg. You have ₹1000 rupees today, so the Future Value will give you the value of 1000 rupees after a certain amount of time \(=future\).
2. What will be the investment \(or a series of investments\) needed today \(present\) which would provide a target amount at a future date? This question asks for the _Present Value._ Eg, if I want ₹1000 after 5 years, what would be the amount \(called Present Value\) which I would need to put in today.

Two types of Interest Calculations:

1. Simple Interest – SI = P x R x T, where P= principal, R= rate of interest and T= time in years. So, if the bank account gives you 4% \(=R\) and you put ₹1000 \(=P\) for 5 years \(=T\), the interest would be \(1000\) x \(4/100\) x \(5\) = 200. And you will get 1000 \(the principal\) and 200 \(the interest\) after 5 years = 1200.
2. Compound Interest – in this each year’s interest also starts to get interest like the principal \(if compounding is yearly\).

| Year | Principal | Rate of Interest | Interest at Year End | Total Value at Year end |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 1000 | 4 | 40 | 1040 |
| 2 | 1040 | 4 | 41.6 | 1081.6 |
| 3 | 1081.6 | 4 | 43.264 | 1124.86 |
| 4 | 1124.86 | 4 | 44.99 | 1169.86 |
| 5 | 1169.86 | 4 | 46.79 | 1216.65 |

Due to the effect of compounding, one would get ₹16.6576 more than what one would have got with simple interest. This looks small, but compounding has great effects over long periods of time.

Eg. For a period of 35 years, an 8% simple interest on ₹1000 would give you a total of ₹3,800 \(1000 principal and 2800 as interest\). With compounding, you would get ₹14,785 \(1000 principal and 13785 as interest\). A 5x difference.

**Future Value of a Single Investment**

FV = \(Present Value of Money\) x \(1 + Rate of Interest\) ^ \(number of years\). For our example of 1000 kept at 4% for 5 years, the calculation would be: FV = \(1000\) x \(1 + 0.04\)^\(5\) Or, FV = \(1000\) x \(1.04\)\(1.04\)\(1.04\)\(1.04\)\(1.04\) Or, FV = 1216.

**Future Value of a Constant Series of Investments** The excel formula of FV is there for this calculation. [A decent web Link](http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/future-value-annuity-calculator.php).

Eg 1: if you put ₹10,000 per year @ 8% interest rate compounded yearly for 35 years, how much would you get? Ans. ₹ 18,61,021.

**Present Value of a Single Amount** If you want to have ₹1000 after 5 years, how much money do you need to put aside today if you can earn 4%. This is the reverse of the calculation of FV. PV = FV _divided by_ \(1 + interest rate\) ^ \(number of years\) PV = 1000 / \(1+0.04\)^5 = 821. This means that the value of ₹ 821 today is the same as ₹ 1000 after 5 years, if we can earn a 4% return on our money.

**Present Value of a Series of Investments**

The excel function PV would be helpful in this. A [weblink](http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/present-value-annuity-calculator.php)

## **Important Points to Remember:**

• The value of money changes with time because it can be invested and earn an interest.

• The longer the time frame, greater would be the difference between the present value and the future value.
